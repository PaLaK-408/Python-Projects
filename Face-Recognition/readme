🔍 About My Face Recognition Tool
📌 Project Overview

The Face Recognition Tool is a Python-based computer vision application that automatically detects and recognizes human faces using a webcam.
It compares live video frames with pre-stored known faces and identifies the person in real time.

🎯 Objectives

Detect human faces from live camera feed

Recognize known individuals accurately

Display name on detected face

(Optional) Mark attendance with date & time

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (cv2) – for video capture & image processing

face_recognition library – for face detection & encoding

NumPy – numerical operations

CSV / Datetime – attendance logging

⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

Load Known Faces

Images stored in Faces/ folder

Convert each face image into a 128-dimensional encoding

Start Webcam

Capture real-time video frames using OpenCV

Face Detection

Detect faces in each frame

Resize frame for faster processing

Face Recognition

Compare live face encodings with known encodings

If match found → display person’s name

Else → mark as Unknown

Attendance (if enabled)

Name + date + time saved in a .csv file

One entry per person per day
